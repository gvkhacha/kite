#kite

Kite is a "Search Engine" made as a part of an Information Retrieval course offered at University of California Irvine.

Though this project does not actually crawl the web, it indexes a dump of about 37,000 "Documents" (In this case, a Corpus with HTML files extracted. URLs for each file is found under bookkeeping.json.)

The first milestone is marked with created an inverted index, while the second implements a search engine for it.
